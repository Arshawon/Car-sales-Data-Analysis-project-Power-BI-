# Car-sales-Data-Analysis-project-Power-BI-
Analyzed car sales data using Power BI, utilizing Power Query for data cleaning and transformation. Applied DAX for advanced calculations and insights. Created interactive visualizations with time intelligence functions to track sales trends and developed dynamic reports for stakeholders to explore sales by region, model, and period.

## Dataset Used
- <a href = "https://github.com/Arshawon/Car-sales-Data-Analysis-project-Power-BI-/blob/main/Car%20Sales.xlsx">Dataset</a>

## Problem Statement

The goal is to create a dynamic Car Sales Dashboard in Power BI that visualizes key performance indicators (KPIs) to track and analyze sales performance. The dashboard will focus on:

KPI Requirements:
- Sales Overview (YTD, MTD, YOY growth, PTYD comparisons)
- Average Price Analysis (YTD, MTD, YOY growth, PTYD comparisons)
- Cars Sold Metrics (YTD, MTD, YOY growth, PTYD comparisons)

Chart Requirements:
- Weekly YTD Sales Trend (line chart)
- YTD Sales by Body Style and Color (pie charts)
- YTD Cars Sold by Dealer Region (map chart)
- Company-wise Sales Trend (grid)
- Detailed Sales Information Grid (table with car model, style,   color, sales data, etc.)

The dashboard will offer real-time insights to help monitor performance, identify trends, and support data-driven decision-making.
## Steps followed 

### Data Import and Pre-processing:

1. Import sales data into Power BI (CSV, Excel).
2. Cleanse the data using Power Query: replace erroneous values (e.g., fix "Double√Ç Overhead Camshaft"), and ensure correct headers by using the first row.
3. Check column quality and distribution in Power Query for errors.

### Creating Calendar Table for Time Intelligence:

Generate a Calendar Table: CALENDAR(MIN(car_data[Date]), MAX(car_data[Date])).

Extract Year, Month, and Week from the Calendar Table for time-based analysis:

Year = YEAR('Calendar Table'[Date])

Month = FORMAT('Calendar Table'[Date], "MMMM")

Week = WEEKNUM('Calendar Table'[Date])

### Data Modeling:

Connect the Calendar Table to the car sales data via the Date column.
Use model view to establish relationships between tables.
### Calculating KPIs with DAX:

1. YTD Sales: TOTALYTD(SUM(car_data[Price ($)]), 'Calendar Table'[Date])
2. PYTD Sales: CALCULATE(SUM(car_data[Price ($)]), SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR('Calendar Table'[Date]))
3. Sales Difference: YTD Sales - PYTD Sales
4. YOY Growth: (Sales Difference) / PYTD Sales
5. MTD Sales: TOTALMTD(SUM(car_data[Price ($)]), 'Calendar Table'[Date])
6. Average Price: SUM(car_data[Price ($)]) / COUNT(car_data[Car_id])
7. YTD Average Price: TOTALYTD([Avg Price], 'Calendar Table'[Date])
8. MTD Average Price: TOTALMTD([Avg Price], 'Calendar Table'[Date])
9. Cars Sold: COUNT(car_data[Car_id])
10. YTD Cars Sold: TOTALYTD(COUNT(car_data[Car_id]), 'Calendar Table'[Date])

Format KPIs as needed, e.g., concatenate sales info and format in millions or thousands.

### Creating Visualizations:

Line Chart: YTD Sales Weekly Trend.

Pie Charts: YTD Sales by Body Style and Color.
Map Chart: Sales distribution by dealer region.
Grid Table: Company-wise sales trend and detailed car sales data.
Area Chart: Display YTD Sales Weekly Trend with max sales point.
Dashboard Design:

Arrange KPIs at the top and detailed visualizations below.
Add slicers for filtering by body style, color, region, and company.
